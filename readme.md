## Getting Started (zsh/Mac)

### Using pyenv and uv

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/knirantar/agentic-poc
cd LangGraph-Course
```

#### 2. Create a virtual env

# Mac/Linux

'''zsh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
'''

# Windows

'''zsh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
'''

#### 3. Install dependencies

'''zsh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

#### 4. Create .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY


# Langchain - 
- Toolkit to build LLM Applications - (chains, tools, agents)
- Linear and reactive chains
- Simple chatbots, RAG Applications, tools usage
- Stateless or partially stateful

# LangGraph - 
- Framework to manage complex worflows with state
- Graph based supports loops, retires, memory
- Multistep workflows
- Fully stateful, remembers and transitions based on logic

# Concepts to Know for Langgraph
- Dictionary - normal dictionary in python
- TypedDictionary
    - used for state in agents in langgraph
    - Provides type safety - explicitly defined types
    - Union - while defining types for typed dictionary we can mention multiple types for more flexibility
    - Optional - while defining types we can make it optional str - but it can be either str or none - it can't be anthing else
    - Any - literally any datatype allowed anything
    - Lambda function
        - Eg. square = lambda x: x * x

- Elements
1. State - shared data structure - that holds the current information or context of entire application
2. Nodes - individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within the graph
3. Graph - Overarching structure that mas out how different tasks are connected and executed
4. Edges - Connections between nodes that determine flow of execution
5. Conditional Edges - specialised connections that decide next node to execute based on specific conditions
6. Start - Start node is virtual entry point in Langgraph, marking where the workflow begins
7. End - End node signifies the conclusion of workflow in langgraph
8. Tools - Specialised functions or utilities that nodes can utilize to perform specific tasks such as fetching data from API
9. ToolNode - special kind of node whose main job is to run a tool
10. StateGraph - class in langgraph used to build and compile graph structure
11. Runnable - Standardized executable component that performs a specific task

- Message Types in LangGraph
1. Human Message - Represents input from user
2. System Message - provide instructions or context to model
3. Function Message - result of a function call
4. AI Message - responses generated by
5. Tool Message



# Crew AI
- Framework that allows us to create AI Agents where each agent has its own expertise and instructions. Together the agents will work towards solving one large complex problems
- Core Components
1. Agents
    - Employee that has particular expertise 
    - We can define role, goal, backstory etc for an agent to work efficiently
2. Tools
    - Tools are used by agents to perform a specific task
    - Builtin langchain tools
    - Custom tools that we can create and use
3. Tasks
    - Jobs or assignments that AI Agents need to complete
    - Also call out which tools that agent needs to use
4. Processes
    - Processes define how agents will work together
    - How tasks will be assigned 
    - How interaction with each other will happen between agents



## Application Deployment
1. Identify Deployable Components
Each subdirectory in repo likely contains a runnable script or flow, such as a CrewAI or LangGraph agent. Common deployment-friendly formats include:

A main script with if __name__ == "__main__" entry point.

A FastAPI, Flask, or Streamlit app file.

#### Example Docker file

'''zsh
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
