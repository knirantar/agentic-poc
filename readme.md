# Langchain - 
- Toolkit to build LLM Applications - (chains, tools, agents)
- Linear and reactive chains
- Simple chatbots, RAG Applications, tools usage
- Stateless or partially stateful

# LangGraph - 
- Framework to manage complex worflows with state
- Graph based supports loops, retires, memory
- Multistep workflows
- Fully stateful, remembers and transitions based on logic

# Concepts to Know for Langgraph
- Dictionary - normal dictionary in python
- TypedDictionary
    - used for state in agents in langgraph
    - Provides type safety - explicitly defined types
    - Union - while defining types for typed dictionary we can mention multiple types for more flexibility
    - Optional - while defining types we can make it optional str - but it can be either str or none - it can't be anthing else
    - Any - literally any datatype allowed anything
    - Lambda function
        - Eg. square = lambda x: x * x

- Elements
1. State - shared data structure - that holds the current information or context of entire application
2. Nodes - individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within the graph
3. Graph - Overarching structure that mas out how different tasks are connected and executed
4. Edges - Connections between nodes that determine flow of execution
5. Conditional Edges - specialised connections that decide next node to execute based on specific conditions
6. Start - Start node is virtual entry point in Langgraph, marking where the workflow begins
7. End - End node signifies the conclusion of workflow in langgraph
8. Tools - Specialised functions or utilities that nodes can utilize to perform specific tasks such as fetching data from API
9. ToolNode - special kind of node whose main job is to run a tool
10. StateGraph - class in langgraph used to build and compile graph structure
11. Runnable - Standardized executable component that performs a specific task

- Message Types in LangGraph
1. Human Message - Represents input from user
2. System Message - provide instructions or context to model
3. Function Message - result of a function call
4. AI Message - responses generated by AI model
5. Tool Message - similar to function message but specific to tool
